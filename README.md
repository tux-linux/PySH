# PySH
Python SHell: UNIX-like shell written entirely in Python<br>It contains some utilities written in Python, which replicate the functions of "ls", "echo", "cat", "pwd", "cd", etc., which you can choose to use by either choosing the **compatibility** or not by choosing the **normal** package. Those utilities could be useful when you're using Windows and don't want to convert your mind to CMD/DOS things. You just have to have Python installed, and then run the file!
